## About
NotiSummary is an Android application that utilizes the power of generative AI technology (ChatGPT) to transform lengthy smartphone notifications into concise and intelligible sentences, allowing users to stay on top of important information without feeling inundated. With NotiSummary, users can effortlessly view all their notifications in a convenient summary form, saving them the time and effort of having to manually sift through each individual notification.


## Background
In today's fast-paced world, people are constantly bombarded with a never-ending stream of notifications from numerous applications on their smartphones. The sheer volume of notifications can be overwhelming and distracting, causing anxiety and stress, and making it difficult for people to focus on important tasks.

To address this issue, NotiSummary was created. The app streamlines the notification management process by minimizing repetition in notifications, identifying essential information, and presenting content in a concise and clear manner. Additionally, NotiSummary offers users the flexibility to customize their summary settings to fit their individual needs,  giving users complete control over their notification experience.


## Features
